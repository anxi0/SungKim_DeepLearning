# ML Basic Concepts

## Unsupervised/Supervised Learning
Supervised: Datas at one thing ex) Let Machine learn with Annotated Cat, Dog or Croissant Pictures  
Unsupervised: un-labled Data ex) Word clustering, Google news grouping

## Supervised Learning
Examples like
- Image labeling
- Email spam filter
- Predict exam score
- Also AlphaGo
Give Features(X) and Labels(Y) to Machine and Ask the machine expected Result

## TF
open source software library for numberical computation using data low graphs.  
### Data Flow Graph
Nodes(Operation) + Edges(Data,Tensors) = Communication of Node
